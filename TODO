Ideas for improvement
---------------------
(The best way to get these done is to send a patch.)

Don't create /sys files for unsupported functions, and don't access those
functions on suspend+resume (requires probing on module load or a huge 
white/blacklist).

Make inhibit_charge_minutes return the time left, not the time originally
set (as returned by the SMAPI BIOS). Requires remembering when 
inhibit_charge_minutes was set and comparing to current time.

Save and and restore inhibit_charge_minutes across suspend-to-disk, as done
for charge thresholds (requires the above time calculations too).

Use the new Linux battery model introduced in kernel 2.6.23 (see the kernel's
Documentation/power_supply_class.txt).
