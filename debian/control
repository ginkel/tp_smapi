Package: tp-smapi-source
Architecture: all
Depends: debhelper (>= 5), module-assistant, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: sysfsutils
Description: ThinkPad hardware/firmware access modules source
 The tp_smapi kernel module exposes some features of the ThinkPad
 hardware/firmware via a sysfs interface. Currently, the main implemented
 functionality is control of battery charging and extended battery status.
 The underlying hardware interfaces are SMAPI and direct access to the
 embedded controller.
 .
 This package also brings the source for an improved version of HDAPS
 which should work on newer ThinkPads too (the stock kernel version does
 not).
 .
 This package contains the source to be built with module-assistant or
 kernel-package.
